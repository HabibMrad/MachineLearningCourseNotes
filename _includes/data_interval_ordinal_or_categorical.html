<h2>Interval, Ordinal, Or Categorical</h2>
<p>Data may come in many different flavors. Let's look at three of the main possibilities.</p>

<h3>Interval</h3>
<p>This is the numerical data we're most familiar with. <b>Interval</b> data lie along some continuum and the intervals between data are consistent. For example, salary is an interval variable because it can be represented meaningfully as a number and the difference between, say, $40,000 and $50,000 is the same amount of money as the difference between $70,000 and $80,000 (Though note that even here we need to be careful: $10,000 <em>is</em> a much bigger raise to someone making $40,000 than someone making $70,000. We can't always rely on things being "the same" in different contexts.)</p>

<h3>Ordinal</h3>
<p><b>Ordinal</b> values also lie along a continuum, but unlike with interval data, the gaps between values of <b>ordinal</b> data may be inconsistent. For example, a survey question may allow you to rate chocolate ice cream on a scale of 1-5. However, the difference between a 1 and a 2 is not guaranteed to mean the same as the difference between a 4 and 5. Perhaps for you, both a 4 and 5 mean that you like the ice cream quite a bit. But a 1 means you absolutely <em>hate</em> chocolate and a 2 means you can tolerate it. In this case, while the data has some <em>ordering</em>, the gaps between the data don't hold consistent meaning. As a result, taking the average of survey results in which responses are clearly ordinal may lead to tricky results. In addition, Ordinal data is often discrete, meaning that intermediate values have no meaning -- no family actually has 2.3 children. In practice, ordinal data is often treated the same as interval, but it is something to keep in mind if that is a limitation of your model.</p>

<h3>Categorical</h3>
<p>Data that come in categories but have no intrinsic ordering are called <b>categorical</b>. For example, you may have data on a person's hair color. Perhaps a value of 1 means the hair is colored black. 2 means blonde. 3 means brunette and so on. There is no inherent meaning to these numbers. You can't take the average of your data and say that the average hair color is 1.5, so that means the average person's hair is between blonde and black.</p>

<p>Many forms of statistical analysis and machine learning models may assume that your data is implicitly of an interval form. Calculating averages, medians, standard deviations make the most sense when your data is on a continuous interval. So what happens if you have data that you suspect is ordinal or categorical?</p>

<p>For example, you may have data on a person that looks like:</p>
<table border="2" width="75%">
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>age</td>
        <td>height (in)</td>
        <td>Hair color</td>
        <td>Likelihood of Voting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>29</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>brunette</td>
        <td>Low</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>33</td>
        <td>67</td>
        <td>black</td>
        <td>High</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>66</td>
        <td>blonde</td>
        <td>Very high</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>One common approach for categorical data is to use <b>One-Hot Encoding</b>. In this approach, you can turn a column of categorical into several columns of 0s and 1s. For example, if you have a column of a person's hair color and it can take on 4 values, you can use One-Hot Encoding to create 4 columns, where each column is a color and a 0 in that column means the hair is not that color and 1 means the hair is that color.</p>

<p>For ordinal data, we want to come up with a representation that does a reasonable job of capturing the order. In this example, we are assuming equal gaps between Very Low, Low, Neutral, High, and Very High, though that might not be appropriate in all cases.</p>

<p>As a result, we can transform our data to become: </p>
<table border="2" width="90%">
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>age</td>
        <td>height (in)</td>
        <td>black</td>
        <td>brunette</td>
        <td>blonde</td>
        <td>redhead</td>
        <td>voting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>29</td>
        <td>70</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>33</td>
        <td>67</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>54</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Note: In addition, there are statistical methods that work well if you are looking to <em>predict</em> ordinal data. This is an intermediate problem between regression and classification.
