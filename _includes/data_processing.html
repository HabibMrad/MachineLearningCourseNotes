<h2>Data Processing</h2>
<p>When starting out with a new dataset, you want to take some time to understand it. For numerical columns, what does the distribution look like? Find the min, max, and average. Look at a histogram or scatter plot of each feature. For text columns, make a set to see what all the unique values are, and perhaps look at the frequency of each.</p>
<p>Oftentimes in real-world problems, the datasets we're analyzing are messy, inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise imperfect. For example, the textual datasets we're looking at may have typos. Datasets may have missing entries or <strong>features</strong> of different data types (e.g., text vs. numbers).</p>
<p>To effectively practice machine learning, we need to learn various ways we can handle these different scenarios. Here are some of the types of data situations you may encounter and some suggestions as to how to deal with them.</p>
