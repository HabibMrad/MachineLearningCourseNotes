<h2>Proxy Values</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the things we really want to use in our models can't be easily measured, or can't be measured at all.</p>

<p>We really want to take into account how easily information spreads in each area, so we include the number of cell phones per person. We want to look for racial disparities, so we use zip codes (or addresses) and last names to guess at the race of each person in the data set (<a target="_blank" href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201409_cfpb_report_proxy-methodology.pdf">see lots of detail here</a>). We think the amount of knowledge a person has might be relevant, so we include how many years of school they completed. We want to include the body fat percentage of each person in our study, but we only have height, weight, and age, so we use BMI as an estimate. We want to know how useful our search results were, so we look at how often people clicked them.</p>

<p>There are often great ways to get a good guess for what we really want. However, it is really important to remember that these are proxies. All too frequently, these numbers take on lives of their own: estimates that work well for groups are applied to individuals, the measure is confused with the actual thing (see <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)">reification</a>), feedback loops mean that the proxy gets pushed further and further away from what we actually wanted. For instance, using numbers of clicks may mean that you end up returning the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2014/08/26/facebook-is-going-to-suppress-click-bait-articles/#72bebf852e79">weirdest or most inflammatory results.</a></p>
