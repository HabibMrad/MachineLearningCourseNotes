<h2>Automation of Labor</h2>

<p>One concern many have about the increased capacity of machines to mimic or perform human behavior is that of automation. Why should a company expend all its resources to hire a human, train them, pay benefits, deal with workplace all while knowing that their employee may quit at any moment? Why not simply replace a human with a machine that you don’t have to feed, cloth, or navigate awkward conversations with? Well, there’s a clear answer right now: much of the labor humans currently perform can’t yet be automated away. Over time, however, more tasks fall into the purview of machines, machines that may be controlled by a very small number of powerful people.</p>
<p>A great deal of automation of labor has already occurred in our history, such as during the Industrial Revolution. Economies adapted and people shifted into new industries. Will that continue to happen in the future, or is it different this time? How should retraining happen?</p>
<p>Even if there will be new jobs for people in the long run, that doesn't necessarily mean it won't be painful for many in the short term. One policy proposal that has collected academic and governmental interest at different times and has resurfaced again recently is that of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2016/10/04/easing-the-pain-of-automation/a-universal-basic-income-would-insure-against-job-loss">Universal Basic Income (UBI)</a>, in which all citizens are given a living stipend independent of what work they do. As a result, they will be able to subsist on a livable wage even if there are few human jobs.</p>
<p>A great deal of jobs that are likely to be automated away are ones that are fundamentally procedural (such as parts of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.xero.com/blog/2016/02/the-end-of-the-beginning-the-next-phase-of-cloud-accounting/">accounting</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.legalrobot.com/">law</a>, and perhaps soon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/the-end-of-code/">software engineering</a>) or require a lot of simple physical movement (driving, packing, shelving, delivering).</p>
<p>What jobs are least likely to be automated away in the near future?</p>
