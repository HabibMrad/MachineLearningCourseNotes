<p>The success of machine learning techniques relies upon having large repositories of data collected. For certain types of problems, companies or researchers may collect this data through logging the interactions we have with website and apps (such as which products we purchase on Amazon, what pages we like on Facebook, what sites we visit, what we search for, and so on).</p>
<p>Repositories of data may be collected without our explicit consent. Even when we do give consent (such as when we agree to the Terms and Services without actually reading it), our data eventually be used for purposes that are not surfaced to us.</p>
<p>Many people are unhappy with the possibility that their information may be used by companies or governments to monitor, label or target them based upon their behavior.</p>
