<h2>Evolutionary Methods</h2>
<p>As the name might suggest, <strong>evolutionary methods</strong> are inspired by the mechanisms of biological evolution.</p>
<p>Unlike with reinforcement learning, where we are trying to find the best policy by taking steps in the best direction from where we are, an evolutionary algorithm tries out several completely different policies. These policies make up the <strong>population</strong> for the current <strong>generation</strong>.</p>
<p>For each generation, we interact with the environment using the policy, and select the policies that work best. These chosen polices, plus combinations and/or mutations of them become the population of the next generation of policies. This new generation is tried out, and the cycle repeats. As the model goes through more generations, the populations get better and better at the task.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://eng.uber.com/deep-neuroevolution/">Uber AI has published a number of papers and some example code showing evolutionary algorithms that can outperform other reinforcement learning techniques on certain tasks.</a> They obtained good results through very simple mechanisms, but they also tried somewhat more sophisticated methods as well. For instance, their <strong>safe mutations</strong> pay attention to how much the change in each parameter affects the outcome, making smaller changes to parameters that have larger effects.</p>
<h3>Suggested Exercise</h3>
<p>Using the techniques described in <a target="_blank" href="https://becominghuman.ai/genetic-algorithm-for-reinforcement-learning-a38a5612c4dc">this tutorial</a>, change the code in <a target="_blank" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jennselby/MachineLearningTutorials/blob/master/ReinforcementLearning.ipynb">this notebook</a> to use an evolutionary method instead. This will get you practice in the difficult task of thinking about how to represent policies.</p>

<p>I recommend that you first try running the example code from the tutorial (as a regular python file, since gym won't run in Jupyter notebook) before you start changing it much, so that you can play around and get a sense of how it works. You will need to delete the last line, the upload. You will also need to install the OpenAI gym, with <pre>python3 -m pip install gym</pre>.</p>
