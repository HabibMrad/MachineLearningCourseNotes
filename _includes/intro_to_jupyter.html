<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<p>I encourage everyone to set up and install a tool called Juypter Notebook. This page will show you how to install and set up Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Before I describe what it is, I encourage you to click on this link to see an example:

<p>Woah. Cool right? This is part of a series of notebooks on Machine Learning created by <a href="http://www.johnwittenauer.net/">John Wittenauer</a> to complement <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">a free online machine learning course</a> taught by Andrew Ng.</p>
<p>Alright, so what is this "Jupyter Notebook"? Jupyter Notebook is a popular and free tool to run Python (and other languages) in your web browser. The tool can make your prototyping and data analysis workflow quicker and more intuitive and help you grasp the ideas more easily.</p>
<p>We're going to install Jupyter Notebooks using pip3. (If you don't remember, pip3 is the "App Store" for Python3 modules. It allows you to install modules written by other people.)</p>
<p>Run the following commands in Terminal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Update your pip program. Older versions may have some issues with dependencies.
<pre>pip3 install --upgrade pip</pre>
</li>
<li>Use pip3 to install Jupyter, which contains a package of tools including Jupyter Notebook
<pre>pip3 install jupyter</pre>
</li>
<li>Start a local Jupyter Notebook server on your computer.
<pre>jupyter notebook</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Running the last command should open your web browser to a locally hosted server that is running Jupyter Notebook. It should look something like the following:</p>

<p>Congratulations! You've now installed Jupyter Notebook and have successfully run it in a web server.</p>
