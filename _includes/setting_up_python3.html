<h2>Setting Up Python3</h2>
<p>First, go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">Python.org</a>, download the latest version of Python (currently 3.7.4), and run the installer.</p>
<p>We will be using a number of extra Python libraries to perform and visualize our data analyses. There are various tools to help you install Python libraries, and <strong>pip</strong> is one of the more commonly used ones, so we will be using that. Because we are using Python3, we need to use <strong>pip3</strong> to install the libraries in the right Python environment.</p>
<p>In Terminal:</p>
<pre>pip3 install matplotlib<br />pip3 install scipy<br />pip3 install scikit-learn</pre>
<p>After you have done this, check to make sure this worked by running</p>
<pre>python3</pre>
<p>and trying the following line at the <strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> prompt:</p>
<pre>import matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn</pre>
<p>If you don't get any errors, you are all set! Hit Ctrl+d to exit the Python prompt.</p>
<p>If you're new to Python, you might want to spend some time outside of class learning the syntax and how it compares to the other languages you know, so that you can more quickly get to the core concepts in your assignments. Since this is not an introductory programming class, we will not be going over these concepts all together, though of course we are always happy to answer questions as they come up.</p>
<p>Here are some resources you can use:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.learnpython.org/">Interactive Python Tutorial</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codecademy Course</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We are also going to rely heavily on the Numpy library, which you may not have used even if you have worked with Python. While we will explain how we are using the library as we go, as this is not something we already expect you to know, you may find it helpful to learn about it beforehand, in which case we recommend this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.learnpython.org/en/Numpy_Arrays">interactive tutorial</a>.</p>
