<h2>Setting up Tensorflow and Keras</h2>
<p>
    In terminal, run
    <pre>pip3 install tensorflow<br />pip3 install keras</pre>
    Tensorflow doesn't officially support python 3.7 yet, so if you have that, you'll need to downgrade to Python 3.6.
    First, get the python 3.6 installer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
    Open a new Terminal window. To confirm you're now running python 3.6, run "python --version" and see that it displays 3.6. 
    Then, install tensorflow and keras as above:
    <pre>pip3 install tensorflow<br />pip3 install keras</pre>
    You'll also need to reinstall jupyter, to make it run Python 3.6:
    <pre>pip3 install jupyter</pre>
