<h2>Setting up Tensorflow and Keras</h2>
<p>
    In terminal, run
    <pre>pip3 install tensorflow<br />pip3 install keras</pre>
    As of 11/21/2019, Tensorflow doesn't officially support python 3.8 yet, so if you have that, you'll need to downgrade to Python 3.7.5. <br/>
    First, get the python 3.7.5 installer <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/">here.</a> Run the installer.<br/>
    Open a new Terminal window. To confirm you're now running python 3.7.5, run "python --version" and see that it displays 3.7.5.<br/>
    Upgrade pip, then install tensorflow and keras as above:
    <pre>pip3 install --upgrade pip<br/>pip3 install tensorflow<br />pip3 install keras</pre>
    You'll also need to reinstall previous packages, to make them run in Python 3.7.5:
    <pre>pip3 install matplotlib<br />pip3 install scipy<br />pip3 install scikit-learn<br/>pip3 install jupyter</pre>
</p>
